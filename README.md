# linear_fit_w_errors
This repository uses Monte Carlo sampling to obtain confidence intervals of linear fits

* Simply replace the data in main.py with your own data
* Play with the Nsamples and the number of Bootstrap Samples to achieve low population sample variance
* The runtime scales as Nsample*Nbootstrap

# How to Run
$ python main.py
